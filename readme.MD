# Mondo-HPO-Learner

## Goal
Our goal is to learn classifications in [MonDO disease ontology](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-disease-ontology), i.e. given existing MonDO classifications, learn fuzzy equivalence axioms. For example, we would like to know what would be a good class expression to define 'late onset Parkinson disease' using terms defined in [HPO ontology](http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io).

## Approach
We leveraged [DL-Learner](http://dl-learner.org) for inductive learning. DL-Learner is an OWL-based inductive learning framework. It allows the learning of class expressions to be used in an equivalent class expression, e.g., given data about people and their relationships, it can learn “Uncle = brother-of o has-child some Male”. Using the DL-Learner, our goal is to ‘learn’ all non-root classes in MonDO.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Please download these files in the root of the cloned directory.

- [MONDO decease ontology](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/pre/mondo.owl)
- [HPO annotations](http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/artifact/misc/phenotype_annotation.tab)
- [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo)

Note that we do not use hp.owl released from the official HPO page because it contains too many complex expressions which cannot be processed by DL-learner's reasoners. We instead used a simplified version of hp.owl which can be generated by hp.obo using [owltools](https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools).

~~~~
    target/owltools hp.obo --no-reasoner --merge-support-ontologies -o hp.owl
~~~~

### Installation and Usage
Once we have all three files, please run the following commands for building and running the executable jar file.

~~~~
    mvn clean compile assembly:single
    java -jar target/mondohpomapper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
~~~~

The execution of this program will generate the HTML files that show mappings between (i) MonDO classes and (ii) HPO classes with accuracy/precision in the 'report' directory. We upload the report directory in this repository as well.
